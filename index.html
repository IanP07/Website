								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Keycaps2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The first layer of a mechanical keyboard, and often the most visually notable one, are keycaps. Keycaps are the pieces of mostly plastic, (although you can get pretty creative with some other materials), that rest on top of your switches, and will mostly have legends, such as letters, numbers and a variety of other graphics showcasing what the key you press will do. There is a lot of creativity and customizability in the mechanical keyboard world though, so it’s not uncommon to find completely blank keycaps, or keycaps with unique graphics or dots. 

									
								
								<p>As mentioned above, there’s a multitude of keycap materials, which will all change the sound, feel, and look of your keyboard. From ceramic, to wood, to metal, to acrylic, to plastic, it depends on what you want for your keyboard, but there’s a good chance that you won’t be let down by the plentiful amount of options available. The sound changes considerably depending on the material you opt for, plastic and acrylic typically have a higher pitched sound, compared to wood and ceramic which naturally sound deeper, and metal is somehow deep and high pitched at the same time? It’s definitely a unique sound. 
									<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep4juaOjIFc">Here's a soundtest, listen for yourself</a></p> 

								<p>Just like keycaps themselves, which are the thing you’ll probably notice first, there’s a good chance that the specific colors of the keycaps will initially catch your eye. There are hundreds if not thousands of great keycap sets, with all the color palettes you can imagine, and possibly a few more that are more of an “acquired taste”. </p>

								<p>Finding the perfect keycap set for your keyboard can really bring it to life and different sets can make your board look entirely different. For example, a minimalistic set to compliment your keyboard and keep the focus on it, or a bright set with matching colors that steals the show. 
								</p>
								<p>It’s definitely worth mentioning that everything said above, and most of what’s written below is a matter of personal preference. Different people will have vastly different opinions on how they want their keyboard to look, sound, and feel, and while this can cause some debate, it’s why keyboards are so amazing. You never really know what you’re going to see, and since it’s a tight knit community, a lot of time the sellers are the same people as the buyers, making certain items for an extremely specific niche, sometimes so specific that it only attracts a few hundred people. “Groupbuys”, a sale that only sells a limited quantity of an item estimated from pre-development interest checks are very common not just to keycaps but also every other part of keyboards. Because of these extremely concentrated but also extremely frequent sales, the variety is incredible and almost always ensures you find what you’re looking for down to the most minute detail.

							<article id="Switches">
								<h2 class="major">Switches</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Switches2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p> 
									Switches can get really complicated really fast, so I’ll keep this as simple as possible. There are a few varieties of switches, but most can be generalized to the following three categories. Linear, Tactile, and Clicky. I’ll be discussing each of them with some visuals, and breaking down each individual component in a switch. 
								</p>
								<p> 
									Linear switches are the simplest kind of switch, and the most common. There’s a good chance if your keyboard is mechanical you have linear switches. 
									Essentially, a linear switch upon pressing it, has a smooth travel, requiring the same amount of force the whole way down and up. 
									It’s a simple switch, no surprises, but it has a clean sound, and feels smooth. For a beginner they’re a great start and you probably won’t find a fault with them.
								</p>
								<p>
									Tactile switches are a bit more experimental. In contrast to linear switches, they don’t have a smooth press, instead, there’s what can be described as a “bump”, an increase in force as you press it down. 
									Different amounts of force will make a tactile more or less “bumpy”, and again, this is all down to personal preference. 
									If you’ve tried a few linear switches and are looking for something new, tactiles are a great way to expand. 
									They sound slightly different but the main difference between them is the feel. 
									Tactile switches accomplish this by extruding a part of the stem of the switch, the plastic piece that moves up and down within a switch, and comes into contact with the metal piece sending 
									an input to a computer. When part of the stem is extruded, 
									it makes it slightly harder to push down, resulting in the “bumpy” feel they’re known for.
								</p>
								<p>
									Clicky switches are less common then both linear and tactile, but if you are within 100 feet of a keyboard using them, you’ll get pretty familiar. 
									Clicky switches, as the name suggests, give off a pretty loud click every time you press the switch down, due to a mechanism within the switch called a “click bar”. 
									Not all clicky switches have a click bar, some have mechanisms like click jackets and others, however click bars are widely regarded to consistently give the best sounding “click”.
									In terms of feel, clicky switches are the same as tactiles, giving off a bumpy feel when pressed down, the only difference being the distinct click you get on a downpress. 
									Whatever kind of switch you end up going for, they all have their pros and if it turns out you don’t love the particular switch you chose, 
									many keyboards now let you swap your switches out for others, a process that’ll be explained further later in this guide. 

									<p>
										Comparison between all 3 types of switches:
										<img src="https://massdrop-s3.imgix.net/img_thread/8I3OR661T3ulauCdZZXY_63d6e74f9a8a4dbaaae6dcaed0b76479.gif?auto=format&fm=gif&fit=min&w=796&dpr=1&q=70">
									</p>

								</p>
									<img src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6116b9604a8e6b639a58a447/6116b9634a8e6b639a58a4a3/6116b9764a8e6b639a58a5c1/1661976657104/tkc_tangerine-linear-switch_diagram.png?format=1500w">
								<p>
									Unlike Keycaps however, there’s a lot more that goes on under the hood, and there are plenty of changes you can make to your switches, even once you 
									have them. As shown in the image above, switches are composed of 4 main parts that separate easily. 
									The first is called the bottom housing. The metal leaf is attached to the bottom housing, and it, by using pins protruding from the bottom, attaches to
									 your keyboard, allowing it to turn physical presses into electrical signals that will be read as input. The next part is the spring. Springs determine
									  the force of the switch, or in other words how hard it is to press down. There can also be longer and shorter springs, changing the travel distance of
									   the switch. The spring fits inside of the bottom housing, and is pressed down by the stem. I mentioned the stem a bit earlier when talking about 
									   different kinds of switches, and if you notice on the image above, the protruding legs on the left side of the switch (facing a diagonal downwards 
									   left angle from the image), is completely straight, indicating a linear switch. The larger leg facing directly downward on the stem fits inside of 
									   the spring, and when the stem is pressed, the force is transferred to the spring, moving it down and compressing it. Then, when the smaller legs 
									   reach the metal leaf, it pushes the two sides towards one another, and upon contact, completes the circuit, sending a signal to your computer.

								</p>

								<p>
									So, why does this matter? Well, commonly, in order to achieve a more pleasant sound, modifying switches in ways like lubricating parts that come in
									 contact with one another often, and even swapping specific parts of one switch with parts from another (commonly referred to as franken switching),
									  can improve the sound and feel of the switch. This is not a massive difference, and recently there are a multitude of switches that were 
									  “pre-lubed” and don’t require any external modification, but if you’re willing to go the extra mile and don’t have anything else to do for the 
									  likely several hours required, you should give it a try at least once, you may find it worthwhile.

							<article id="Case">
								<h2 class="major">Case</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Base.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p> 
									A case is really what brings everything together. The case or base of a keyboard, which can sometimes be 1 piece, or upwards 
									of 5, holds all the components together (assuming you've done everything correctly.) There are again really too many things to mention just in this guide, but hopefully this gives a basic idea, and 
									for a build guide on certain keyboards, you can check out my specific keyboard build articles. 
								</p>
								<p>
									If you thought keycaps or switches had a lot of options, cases take it to a whole new level. You’ve probably seen some 
									if you’ve been going through the website, and that's not even scratching the surface of the sheer amount of options you 
									have. 
									
									<p>Some materials include aluminum, steel, brass, copper, plastic, acrylic, wood, and 
									a variety of finishing options like anodization or sandblasting for a more simple finish, and PVD for a mirror-like 
									finish. Rather than trying to explain, I’ve attached some of my favorite and most unique designs below, and as there 
									are constantly more boards being released, I’m sure there will be many more to come. </p>

										I could probably show about 30 more incredible designs just off the top of my head, but you probably get the idea. So, what exactly does any of this 
										do? Is it just for looks? Well kind of, but there are also other differences in sound and feel based on the materials and construction of 
										your keyboard. For example, a weight, either internal or external, aside from making your keyboard a great paperweight, can make the sound more full,
										 and not hollow or “pingy”. 

									</p>
									<p>
										Weights can be made out of a multitude of materials as shown above, and can be a variety of colors and finishes. A benefit over the past few years,
										 is the amount of customization to all this. For example, a keyboard like the <a href="https://qwertyqop.com/pages/qk65v2">QK65 v2</a>, a new release by qwerty 
										 keys is incredibly customizable, allowing you to change options like the case, weight, LED screen bezel, and unique badges that magnetically attach 
										 to the back of the keyboard. So for example, if you want a mirror-like weight, you can choose that as your option, making the same keyboard look
										  completely different from user to user. 

									</p>
									<p>
										Well, hopefully you have at least a basic idea of all the different parts of a keyboard, at least the main ones. There are some others that go into
										 making a keyboard work, like a PCB, specific pieces based on your mounting option, and Plates. These will all be discussed in the assembly section,
										  but feel free to look around at some websites to find some awesome keyboards, I’m sure you’ll find at least one that you like the look of.

								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Assembly.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Finally, it’s time to assemble your keyboard. Similar to the other steps above, there are a lot of different ways to
									 assemble a keyboard, which almost always depends on the board itself. However, I aim to give you a general idea, from 
									 which you can always look up specific assembly guides in the form of written or visual guides which should walk you 
									 through it step by step. The first step to assembly is called the “plate assembly”. The plate assembly contains your 
									 keyboard pcb, plate, although a plate isn’t always strictly necessary, your switches which we talked about earlier, 
									 stabilizers, and other optional addons to change sound and feel, like foam to dampen the sound. 
									</p>
									<img src="https://www.alexotos.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/DSCF0208.jpg" width="100%" height="100%">
									<p> 
										The first thing you will want to do is put your stabilizers in. Stabilizers act as support for the larger keys like the spacebar, enter, and shift
										 keys. Otherwise, if you pressed on the far right or left side of the spacebar, it would tilt like a seesaw, instead of moving down straight. You will
										  probably want to lube and tune your stabilizers, unlike switches where it can sometimes be fine to just go with them as is, you’ll want to take the
										   time to make sure your stabilizers sound good as there will be on keys you’ll use often and unfortunately most don’t come with good enough factory 
										   lube, if any. You’ll also want to ensure your stabilizer wire is straight, and when everything’s good you can insert it into your pcb by clipping it
										through the holes made for it. If you want a more in depth explanation on this step, you should check out this excellent guide by Alexotos explaining 
										the whole process in exact detail <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxHb6CJc9V8 "> here.</a>
									</p>
									<p>
										Now, after your stabilizers, comes the time to put your switches in. If your pcb is “hot swap” or doesn’t require you to solder switches on, you can
										 simply push them down into the pcb, making sure to support the pcb from the other side and press evenly to ensure no pins get bent (that will destroy
										the switch in some cases), until you hear it pop into place. If you’re not sure if your pcb is hot swap you can flip your pcb over, and if you see 
										anything similar to this (kailh hotswap sockets), you’re good to go. If there’s nothing there, you likely have to solder the switches in yourself, 
										however if you’re not comfortable doing this there’s almost definitely a solderable pcb option for the keyboard you choose nowadays, or third party 
										options you can use. 

									</p>
									<p>
										This will hopefully be touched on in much more detail for your specific board, but every board has a specific “mounting style”. This changes both the
										 sound and especially feel of the board. Attached below is an image of some of the most common types of mounting styles:

									</p>
									<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/61577c47835b9e092ea37012/0c494c56-a9eb-4679-b3a2-c063a2266222/Mounting-Style-Summary.jpg" width="100%" height="100%"> 
									<p>
										These are far from the only kinds of mounting options, an example of a different one is an o-ring mount. This involves placing a large flexible band 
										in between your plate and pcb and then placing the completed assembly in your case, to then be closed up by the top case, if your keyboard case is 
										split into two halves. No matter the mounting style, once you’ve completed your plate assembly, you’re ready to finish your build. 
									</p>
									<p>
										You will again need to look at your specific keyboard’s instructions to figure out how to put it back together, there are many different ways, usually
										 involving screws but there are some boards which are completely built with magnets. One example is a two piece screw in assembly, (checkout my 
										 designated freebird TKL build guide for specifics), where you rest the plate assembly in between the top and bottom case, then flip the keyboard over 
										 and screw the top and bottom case together. Once you assemble your keyboard, you’re pretty much done! You can do some testing, and if you ever want 
										 to change something which can happen commonly it isn’t too hard to disassemble it and put it back together again, in fact some were pretty much
										  designed with that in mind, like magnetic keyboards. 
									</p>
									<p>
										I hope you learned something from this guide, and I appreciate anyone who read it all the way until the end, I know it was a lot and I wasn’t really
										 able to cover everything about every topic, because there’s simply too much, but there’s a multitude of other websites, videos, and communities that
										  you can fully utilize to delve deep into every aspect of custom keyboards.
